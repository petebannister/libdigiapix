This fork was taken in order to implement a polled mode on the CAN interface.
The existing library has exceptionally high CPU usage (on the ConnectCore6UL 
at least).

Multi-threading this is unnecessary for many applications and also a risk 
especially if the documentation does not cover how to use the library safely.

The CAN data callbacks do not include a client pointer or even the can interface 
pointer, making the API inconvenient to use in some cases, particularly from C++
code.

Polled mode via ldx_can_poll_one enables callbacks to be avoided entirely.

Digi APIX Library
=================
Digi APIX is a C library that enables you to easily access and manage Digi
ConnectCore platform interfaces.

Supported interfaces:

  * ADC
  * CAN
  * GPIO
  * I2C
  * PM
  * PWM
  * SPI
  * WATCHDOG

The [Digi Embedded Yocto Examples](https://github.com/digi-embedded/dey-examples)
repository provides examples of using this API to connect and work with your
device interfaces.

Compiling the library
---------------------
The Digi APIX C library is meant to be used by Digi Embedded Yocto, which
includes recipes to build the package. It's also part of the default images
generated by Digi Embedded Yocto.

It can be also compiled using a Yocto based toolchain. In that case, make
sure to source the corresponding toolchain for the platform you want to build
the library for, e.g:

```
#> . <DEY-toolchain-path>/environment-setup-cortexa7hf-neon-dey-linux-gnueabi
#> make
```

Library dependencies
--------------------
This library depends on [libsoc](https://github.com/jackmitch/libsoc). To
compile it out of Yocto, use a toolchain with _libsoc_ library included.
